The script will read from the test and train directory the datas and the different labels from the main directory. It will merge together the datas gathered from the test and the training (only the mean and standard derivation values) while keeping updated the labels. The new data set created will betidy and ready to use.

Finally, it will compute the mean values of each variable for avery subject and every activity into a tidy data set that will be written in .txt format.
